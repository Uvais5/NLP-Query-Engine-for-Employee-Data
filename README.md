# NLP-Query-Engine-for-Employee-Data

# NLP-Query-Engine

## Project Overview

This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Query Engine designed to interact with both **structured** (SQL database) and **unstructured** (documents/RAG) data sources. The core goal is to provide a unified, schema-agnostic interface that allows users to query employee data using plain English, eliminating the need to write complex SQL or search through large document repositories.

## üéØ Use Case & Purpose

This project is ideal for:

- üíª **AI Engineering Demos** showcasing a full-stack RAG system with dynamic schema integration.
- üè¢ **Enterprise Search Solutions** where users need to query both structured employee records and unstructured policy documents.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Testing and Learning** advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures using Sentence-Transformers and FAISS.
- üéì **Educational Demos** in database schema introspection and NL-to-SQL generation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This system uses local, open-source models (Sentence-Transformers) and is highly configurable. Performance relies heavily on the quality of the model and the structured data schema.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic Schema Discovery:** Connects to a database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and automatically discovers table, column, and relationship metadata using **SQLAlchemy** (see `schema_discovery.py`).
* **Natural Language to SQL:** Generates suggested SQL queries from English questions, adapting to the discovered schema.
* **Unstructured Data Indexing (RAG):**
    * Supports ingestion of documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) via a multi-threaded, asynchronous process.
    * Uses **Sentence-Transformers** for generating high-quality vector embeddings.
    * Employs **FAISS** for highly performant vector indexing and semantic search.
* **Performance Optimization:** Includes in-memory query caching, request metrics, and a dedicated health check endpoint.
